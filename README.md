# ACO-VRP-optimization
Implementation of an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) heuristic for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with capacity constraints. This project includes experiments comparing the ACO results with Google OR-Tools and provides a comprehensive analysis of solution quality and algorithm performance.
